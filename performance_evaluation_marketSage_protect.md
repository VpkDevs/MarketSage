# MarketSage Protect Performance Evaluation

## Overview

This document summarizes the performance evaluation of the MarketSage Protect feature, focusing on the effectiveness of the risk assessment components.

## Performance Findings

1. **Model Path**: The model path in both `aiDetector.ts` and `smartRiskAssessment.ts` needs to be updated to point to the actual model file.
2. **Preprocessing Logic**: The preprocessing logic is currently a placeholder and requires implementation to ensure that input data is correctly formatted for the model.
3. **Testing**: Unit tests should be created to validate the functionality of the `ScamDetectionModel`, `SecurityAnalyzer`, and `SmartRiskAssessment` classes.

## Recommendations for Updates

1. **Update Model Paths**: Ensure that the model paths are correctly set in the respective files.
2. **Implement Preprocessing Logic**: Develop the preprocessing logic to format input data appropriately.
3. **Create Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for the classes to ensure their functionality and robustness.

## Conclusion

The MarketSage Protect feature is well-structured but requires updates to enhance its performance and reliability. Addressing the identified gaps will improve its effectiveness in risk assessment.
