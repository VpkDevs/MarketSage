# 4. Supplemental Document 3: Conceptual Project Structure Outline

**Project Phases (Agile/Iterative Approach Recommended):**

1.  **Phase 1: MVP - Core Functionality (Focus: Problem Validation & Core Value)**

    - **Sprint 1-4:** Foundation - Basic Platform Integration (API access for 1-2 core marketplaces), Core Product Search (Keyword search, basic filters), Basic Product Display (Aggregated info), Unified Shopping Cart (Single platform initially, basic cart management), User Accounts/Authentication, Basic Backend Infrastructure.
    - **Goal:** Launch a functional MVP to validate core concept and gather initial user feedback. Limited feature set but working core functionalities.

2.  **Phase 2: Trust & Discovery Enhancement (Focus: Addressing Key Pain Points)**

    - **Sprint 5-8:** Implement SynergyShop Trust Score & Seller Verification (Basic level), Refined Search & Filters (Advanced filters, visual search initial integration), Personalized Product Feed (Basic recommendations), Shipping Aggregation & Basic Tracking (For initial marketplaces).
    - **Goal:** Significantly improve user trust and product discovery. Introduce key differentiator features.

3.  **Phase 3: UX & Platform Expansion (Focus: Usability & Reach)**

    - **Sprint 9-12:** UI/UX Revamp based on user feedback, Expanded Marketplace Integration (Add more platforms), Improved Communication Features (Basic Translation), Centralized Order Dashboard & Returns Management (Basic flow).
    - **Goal:** Enhance user experience, expand platform reach, and streamline core shopping workflows.

4.  **Phase 4: Advanced Features & Community (Focus: Differentiation & Engagement)**
    - **Sprint 13+ (Ongoing):** Advanced AI Features (Semantic Search, Predictive Recommendations), Refined Shipping & Logistics Optimization, Dispute Assistance Program (Premium Feature), Community Features (Reviews, Forums, etc.), Advanced Monetization Feature Rollout, Continuous Iteration & Improvement based on data and user feedback.
    - **Goal:** Solidify market leadership, build strong community, expand feature set to further differentiate and enhance user value, optimize business model.

**Key Project Components/Modules (Technical Perspective):**

- **Frontend (Mobile App & Web App):** UI/UX design, user interface development (React Native/Flutter for cross-platform mobile, React/Vue.js for web).
- **Backend (API & Server):** API development (RESTful APIs), data aggregation and processing from platform APIs, AI algorithms (search, personalization), user account management, order management system, database (scalable NoSQL or relational), server infrastructure (cloud-based, scalable).
- **Trust & Verification Module:** Logic for calculating Trust Score, seller verification system, data sources integration (review APIs, etc.).
- **Shipping & Logistics Module:** API integrations with shipping providers (where possible, or scraping shipping information), logic for shipping cost and time calculation, tracking integration.
- **Communication & Translation Module:** Integration with translation APIs, potential development of AI-powered communication assistant features.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Secure integration with payment processors.

**Technology Stack (Example - adaptable based on team expertise):**

- **Frontend:** React Native (Mobile), React (Web)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Python (FastAPI/Flask)
- **Database:** MongoDB (Scalable NoSQL) or PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- **AI/ML Libraries:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLP Libraries for translation & sentiment analysis.
