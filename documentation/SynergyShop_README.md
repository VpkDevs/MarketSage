# SynergyShop: Your Intelligent Shopping Layer

**Project Description:**

SynergyShop is a revolutionary mobile and web application designed to enhance the online shopping experience from global marketplaces like Temu, AliExpress, DHGate, Banggood, and Made-in-China. It acts as an intelligent intermediary, unifying these platforms and providing features to improve product discovery, trust, shipping, returns, and overall user experience.

**Key Features (MVP - as of [Date]):**

- Unified Product Search: Search across multiple supported marketplaces simultaneously.
- Aggregated Product Display: View product information from various platforms in a consistent and clear format.
- Basic Product Filtering & Sorting.
- SynergyShop Trust Score (Basic Implementation - Beta): Initial seller trust indicators based on aggregated data.
- Unified Shopping Cart (Single Platform in MVP - Expansion planned): Basic cart management for a selected primary marketplace (e.g., AliExpress in MVP).
- User Account Creation and Management.

**Getting Started (For Developers/Contributors - Conceptual):**

1.  **Clone the repository:** `git clone [repository URL - Placeholder]`
2.  **Frontend Setup (React Native / React):**
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
    - Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
    - Run the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start` (For web) / `react-native start` (For mobile - requires React Native development environment setup)
3.  **Backend Setup (Node.js/Python):**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
    - Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - Set up database environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string, database name) in `.env` file.
    - Run the backend server: `node server.js` or `python app.py`
4.  **API Keys & Platform Integrations:**
    - Obtain API keys (if required - or explore web scraping approaches with necessary ethical and legal considerations) for target marketplaces (AliExpress, Temu, etc.).
    - Configure API keys in the backend environment variables or configuration files.

**Security Considerations:**

- **Secure API Access:** SynergyShop prioritizes secure API key management and secure communication channels (HTTPS) for platform integrations. Sensitive data (API keys, user credentials) is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Data Security:** User data is stored securely with appropriate encryption measures. We adhere to data privacy best practices. We will aim for compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) as our user base expands globally.
- **Payment Security:** Payment processing is handled through reputable and PCI-compliant payment gateway providers. SynergyShop does not directly store sensitive payment information.
- **Regular Security Audits:** We plan to conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

**Data Privacy & User Trust:**

- **Transparency:** We are committed to transparency in our data collection and usage practices. Our privacy policy (link to policy document - Placeholder) will clearly outline what data we collect, how it is used, and user control options.
- **User Data Minimization:** We strive to collect only data that is necessary for providing and improving the SynergyShop experience.
- **User Control:** Users will have control over their data within the app settings, including options to access, modify, and delete their data.
- **Ethical AI & Personalization:** Our AI algorithms are designed to enhance user experience without compromising user privacy. We will avoid manipulative or privacy-invasive personalization practices.
- **No Selling of User Data:** SynergyShop will not sell user data to third parties. Monetization will primarily focus on value-added services (affiliate, verified seller programs, premium features), not data exploitation.

**Platform Support Roadmap & Future Integrations:**

- **Currently Supported Platforms (MVP):** AliExpress, Temu (Phase 1 MVP focus).
- **Platforms Planned for Integration (Near Future):** DHGate, Banggoo
  d, Made-in-China (Phase 3 focus, Q4 2024 - Q1 2025 roadmap).
- **Future Platform Expansion (Visionary - subject to user demand and technical feasibility):** Gearbest, Taobao (Global Version if available with suitable API), Shein (explore integration possibilities - complex due to their ecosystem).
