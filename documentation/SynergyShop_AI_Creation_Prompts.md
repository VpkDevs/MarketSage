# 3. Supplemental Document 2: AI Creation Prompt Example (For UI/UX Design Assistance)

**Prompt for an AI Design Tool (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E for UI Mockups, or specialized UI/UX AI tools):**

> **Subject:** "Generate UI/UX mockup designs for a mobile shopping app screen called 'SynergyShop Product Search Results'."
>
> **Description:** "The screen should display product search results aggregated from multiple e-commerce platforms like AliExpress, Temu, DHGate etc. Prioritize clean, modern, and trustworthy design. Display product images prominently, clear product titles, star ratings (SynergyShop Trust Score, emphasized), price comparison from different platforms (if available, subtly indicated), and prominent 'Add to Cart' or 'View Product' buttons. Use a grid layout suitable for mobile browsing. Consider using design elements that subtly communicate 'trust' and 'intelligence'. Style should be minimalist and focused on product information, avoiding overly flashy or cluttered design. Think 'modern e-commerce app UI', inspired by Pinterest, modern online retail, but emphasizing trust and aggregated data."
