=== Analyze Webpack Configuration Files ===
Completed: 2024-01-18

The analysis of the Webpack configuration files was conducted to understand the project's build setup and asset management. The following configuration files were reviewed:

1. **webpack.common.js**:
   - Defines entry points for the application.
   - Configures loaders for TypeScript, CSS, and image assets.
   - Sets up plugins for copying assets and generating HTML files.

2. **webpack.dev.js**:
   - Extends the common configuration for development.
   - Enables source maps for easier debugging.
   - Configures watch options to ignore `node_modules`.

3. **webpack.prod.js**:
   - Extends the common configuration for production.
   - Enables code minimization and optimizes chunk splitting.
   - Configures source maps for production debugging.

Key Findings:
- The project is well-structured for both development and production environments.
- Effective use of Webpack features for asset management and optimization.
