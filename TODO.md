# TODO List

## Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

- [x] Analyze major files in the project
- [x] Document findings in a comprehensive overview
- [x] Update README.md with project goals, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Update .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files
- [ ] Verify and update requirements.txt
- [ ] Create a virtual environment if none exists
- [ ] Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- [ ] Document setup process in README.md

## Phase 2: Implementation

### CI/CD Pipelines and Automation

- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions / Jenkins / CircleCI for:
  - [ ] Code testing
  - [ ] Deployment
  - [ ] Linting
- [ ] Integrate Unit tests, Integration tests and End-to-End tests
- [ ] Set up frameworks:
  - [ ] Pytest for Python backend testing
  - [ ] Jest/Mocha for JavaScript testing
  - [ ] Cypress/Selenium for UI testing

### Code Quality and Optimization

- [ ] Implement try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- [ ] Add logging mechanisms for tracking issues
- [ ] Implement secure authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth2, JWT)
- [ ] Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, CDN)
- [ ] Optimize database queries with indexing and query profiling
- [ ] Refactor inefficient algorithms

### UI/UX and Feature Development

- [ ] Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- [ ] Follow accessibility guidelines (e.g., WCAG)
- [ ] Conduct user testing for feedback
- [ ] Prioritize features based on user feedback and project goals
- [ ] Implement a consistent design language and branding

### Bug Fixing and Testing

- [ ] Set up tools for tracking bugs (e.g., GitHub Issues)
- [ ] Categorize bugs by severity and impact
- [ ] Ensure automated tests cover all critical paths

## Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Self-Asking: Evaluate immediate priorities
- [ ] Self-Validation: Ensure feasibility and actionability
- [ ] Self-Criticism: Identify challenges and inefficiencies
- [ ] Self-Reflection: Iterate on the planning process for improvements
